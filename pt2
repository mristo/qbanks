As a student-led corporation, our goal is to deliver a comprehensive study resource at a small cost while donating our profits to charity. We can afford to do this because of the large community of student contributors who continue to believe that accessible knowledge is more important than financial wealth and have therefore donated their time to make this project a reality.","p2":"Several studies over the past decade have demonstrated that question development helps to consolidate information, uncover previously held misconceptions and ultimate retain information more quickly and efficiency. There is therefore as much to gain from purchasing the question bank as there is from contributing to it. Any medical student across Canada can become a the OQB Contributor!","p3":"Proceeds are donated to various Canadian organizations that support medical students, residents, and allied healthcare members. As of September 2023, The Question Bank has raised $13,000 for charity.","p4":"Welcome again to the OQB community and all the best in your academic journey!","feature_1_h":"Number of questions","feature_1_d":"More than 4,200 MCQs and 60 CDMQs covering every uOttawa pre-clerkship lecture, including general medical theory, pathophysiology, physician skills development, case-based decision-making, anatomy, histology, pathology, and radiology.","feature_2_h":"Regularly-updated and peer-reviewed","feature_2_d":"New questions are added on an ongoing basis and existing content is updated to reflect current practice guidelines. Moreover, all questions have undergone five rounds of thorough peer-review to ensure accuracy, appropriate difficulty, and relevance to the curriculum.","feature_3_h":"User-friendly platform","feature_3_d":"Questions are completed on our updated portal, allowing for an experience that closely mimics virtual MCQ examinations throughout pre-clerkship.

I am currently an internal medicine resident at the University of Toronto, based at Sunnybrook Hospital. Outside of medicine I love hiking and going to the gym. I’m an avid non-fiction reader and hockey enthusiast, and spend as much time as I can with my friends and family, either on long walks or at one of Toronto’s many cafés. I have a strong passion for medical education and teaching, and love working in the team environment of internal medicine. While serving as the VP Academic of the uOttawa’s medical student society, I was surprised with the scarcity of Canadian-focused practice questions, and thus was born the Ottawa Question Bank as an attempt to provide medical students across Canada and abroad with a comprehensive, bilingual study resource."},"isabelle":{"photo_alt":"Portrait of Isabelle Lefebvre","name":"Isabelle Lefebvre, B.H.Sc.","role":"","bio":""},"rikesh":{"photo_alt":"Portrait of Rikesh Raichura","name":"Rikesh Raichura","role":"","bio":""}}},"tutorial":{"title":"Tutorial","description":"This brief tutorial will provide a run-through of the platform and how it can be used to optimize your learning.

Once a user logs in, they are brought to the site’s landing page, shown below.","step_1.2":"Navigating to the “Questions” tab from the left-hand menu will bring the user to the entire Ottawa Question Bank, which is organized into five units: Foundations Unit, Unit I, Unit II, Unit III, and Unit IV.","step_1.3":"Within each unit, there are several topics which, when their questions are totalled, equate to over 4,200 multiple-choice questions and more than 60 clinical decision-making questions. Our repository of questions will continue to grow over time.","step_2.1":"As an example, let’s look at Unit I, which covers cardiology, respirology, oncology, and nephrology. Below is a snapshot of the first topics of Unit I.","step_3.1":"Let’s now navigate to “02 — Heart failure” to access the quizzes available for the topic of heart failure.","step_3.2":"A green dot preceding a lecture title indicates that the user has attempted this quiz.","step_3.3":"The “Attempts” column alerts the user to how many times they have attempted that quiz (quizzes can be attempted an unlimited number of times).","step_3.4":"The “Best Score” column denotes the user’s highest achieved score for a given quiz.","step_4.1":"Let’s attempt the “Heart Failure” quiz to get an idea of the user interface when attempting a quiz.","step_4.2":"Note that great care has gone into creating a user interface that is similar to what may be seen on the uOttawa online medical school exams, which is also similar to the MCCQE1 interface.","step_4.3":"When attempting a quiz, users will note four icons in the top-right corner: a globe, a moon, a caution symbol (an exclamation mark within a triangle), and an exit symbol (an x within a circle).","step_4.4":"Clicking on the globe will allow the user to toggle between English and French.","step_4.5":"Clicking on the moon will change the “theme” from light to dark (great for making late-night study sessions less tiresome on the eyes).","step_4.6":"Clicking on the caution symbol allows the user to provide feedback about the current question. A popup will appear with a textbox for the user to provide comments or explanations.","step_4.7":"Clicking on the exit symbol will pause the quiz attempt (which can be resumed at any time) and bring the user to the results page.","step_5.1":"Below is an example of a question as it would appear to the user. Once an answer option is selected, the user is notified of the correct answer and a detailed answer key is available explaining why both the correct and incorrect answers are as such.","step_6.1":"Once a quiz is complete, the user will be directed to a summary page as seen below. Users can also compare their score to the average score achieved by all other users who have attempted that particular quiz.","step_7.1":"If a user were to now return to this same quiz, they would encounter the following page. Here the user can find their previous attempts, review individual attempts, and start a new attempt.","step_8.1":"Now let’s navigate to the “Performance” tab on the left-hand side of the screen, as seen below. Here the user can get a large-scale overview of their progress through the Ottawa Question Bank and can also begin to learn about potential areas for improvement.
